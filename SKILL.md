description: Run local offline soft-sensor AutoResearch with FDE TabPFN3, low-risk trend/window/coverage features, mean R-squared candidate ranking, and an interactive Plotly fitability report. Use only when the user explicitly names $soft-sensor-autoresearch or asks to run the soft-sensor AutoResearch skill.

# Soft Sensor AutoResearch

Use this skill only after explicit invocation.

Required user inputs:
- Dataset file path (`.csv` or `.parquet`)
- Target column name

Before running, check local FDE/model availability. Do not silently fall back to XGBoost if the requested FDE model is unavailable.

Inside FDE Foundry, use `soft-sensor-autoresearch-policy` only. It produces bounded
candidate/window policy and always stops for data-modeling-engineer selection. Foundry
alone maps that policy plus an approved `input_asset_id` to `FDEKernelProvider`; this
Skill must not import FDE source code or invoke benchmark runners in the governed path.

Read `references/fde-integration.md` when FDE discovery, TabPFN weights, or environment checks are relevant.
Read `references/search-policy.md` when explaining or modifying the search strategy.

Run:

```bash
python scripts/run_soft_sensor_autoresearch.py <data-file> <target-column>
```

Useful options:
- `--time-budget-minutes <minutes>` controls the search budget; default is 15. Use `0` to remove the time cap and run the full finite candidate list.
- `--num-train-samples <n>` controls the ICL context size; reduce this on memory-limited laptops.
- `--top-features-n <n>` controls how many ranked features enter the model; default is 32.
- `--validation-fraction <fraction>` controls the total target-label fraction held out across robust windows; default is `0.30`.
- `--window-minutes <minutes>` overrides the context window. When omitted, infer it from the dataset sampling interval.
- `--forecast-horizons <steps>` evaluates future-target horizons. Use `0` for same-time prediction, `0:10` for h=0 through h=10, or comma lists such as `0,1,3,6,10`. A horizon step is one dataset sampling step, so h=10 on 10-minute data is 100 minutes ahead.
- `--model-type <tabpfn3|tpt>` selects the FDE model path. Default is `tabpfn3`.
- `--tabpfn-device <cpu|auto|mps|cuda>` controls TabPFN device; default is `auto`, preferring MPS when PyTorch reports it is available. On Apple Silicon, `auto` fails fast when PyTorch is built with MPS but the runtime cannot see Metal devices; pass `cpu` explicitly only when CPU fallback is intended.
- `--tabpfn-fit-mode <mode>` controls TabPFN preprocessing/cache mode; default is `fit_preprocessors` for stable local MPS validation.
- `--tabpfn-n-estimators <n>` controls TabPFN ensemble size; default is `1` for stable local MPS validation. The upstream TabPFN default is larger and may crash on this local FDE/MPS stack.
- `--tpt-device <cpu|auto|mps|cuda>` controls TPT_tab device; default is `mps`.
- `--tpt-fit-mode <mode>` controls TPT_tab preprocessing/cache mode; default is `fit_preprocessors`.
- `--tpt-n-estimators <n>` controls TPT_tab ensemble size; default is `1` for fast laptop validation.
- `--fde-root <path>` points to a local FDE or benchmark checkout.
- `--output-dir <path>` overrides the output directory; default is next to the dataset.
- Resource usage logging is enabled by default and writes `resource_usage.csv` next to `report.html`.
- `--resource-log-interval-seconds <seconds>` controls process-tree CPU/RSS sampling; default is `2.0`.
- `--no-resource-log` disables the default resource log.
- The default search evaluates an identity baseline using the dataset's existing columns, then trend/window/coverage candidates.
- `--include-frequency-candidate` enables the tsfresh/frequency candidate. It is off by default because it can expand to tens of thousands of features and dominate long runs.

Report header:
- `report.html` begins with a `Run Parameters` section. Check this first before interpreting model scores.
- The section records the target tag, data file, model type, inferred or overridden window size, ICL training sample count, top feature count, validation fraction, forecast horizons, frequency-candidate setting, FDE root, and model-specific runtime parameters such as device, fit mode, and estimator count.
- Candidate rows record their effective horizon, while the header records the shared ICL training sample count and other run-level parameters. Compare candidate scores together with these parameters instead of reading R² alone.

Forecast horizon interpretation:
- h=0 uses the feature window ending at t to predict the target at t.
- h>0 uses the feature window ending at t-h to predict the target at t. This keeps holdout target time ranges fixed across horizons and makes R²/RMSE across h=0..N comparable for lag estimation.
- Training context excludes rows whose feature anchor time or future target time falls inside the holdout interval, so future-target evaluation does not leak holdout-window information into training.
- Compare mean R², worst holdout R², RMSE, and MAE by horizon. A later horizon outperforming h=0 can indicate usable early-prediction signal at that lead time; validate against target autocorrelation and domain causality before calling it process dead time.

Negative-R² triage:
- Treat a strongly negative R² from all low-risk candidates as a diagnostic failure, not as a prompt to expand synthetic formula features.
- Read the per-holdout RMSE, MAE, target standard deviation, and RMSE/std in the report. If target variance is tiny, R² can look extreme even when absolute moisture error is small.
- Before expanding the feature search, compare holdout target distributions, batch coverage, and whether one holdout is an out-of-distribution batch/time segment.
- Prefer raw, trend/rolling, and optionally frequency features. Do not use SISSO-style synthetic feature candidates for this skill.

Model weights:
- `--model-type tabpfn3` uses FDE foundation TabPFN3 regressor weights under `weights/tabpfn3/*regressor*.ckpt`.
- `--model-type tpt` uses FDE `TPTTabRegressor` with `$FDE_TPT_WEIGHTS_DIR/TPT_tab/model.ckpt`.

MPS execution:
- Prefer TabPFN3 on MPS for Apple Silicon runs.
- In Codex, Metal devices may be hidden inside the normal sandbox even when the Mac has a supported Apple GPU. If `--tabpfn-device auto` or `mps` reports MPS unavailable on Apple Silicon, verify with an escalated MPS smoke test and rerun the AutoResearch command with `sandbox_permissions="require_escalated"`.
- Do not silently fall back to CPU for Apple Silicon MPS runs. Use `--tabpfn-device cpu` only when the user explicitly wants CPU.

TPT_tab runs in an isolated child process. This avoids Metal/TPT runtime crashes caused by fitting TPT in the same Python process that just performed FDE feature extraction.

Resource logging records process-tree CPU percent and RSS memory. MPS runs may also append `mps_event` rows with PyTorch MPS allocated/driver memory at fit/predict stages. Apple GPU utilization and power require sudo `powermetrics`, so do not describe MPS memory rows as true GPU utilization percent.

Return the final `report.html` and `resource_usage.csv` paths and summarize the best mean R-squared score.
